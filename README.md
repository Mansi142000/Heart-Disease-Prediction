Heart Disease Prediction Project
•	Data science project combining over 900 observations from five distinct datasets, to predict heart disease outcomes using machine learning.

•	Implemented and compared various supervised ML algorithms including Linear Regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Tree, achieving a notable model accuracy of 88.4%.

•	Performed exhaustive metric-driven analysis to identify the most effective predictors of heart disease, directly contributing to advancements in early detection and preventive healthcare strategies.
